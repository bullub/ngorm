//Package ngorm is a Go Object relation mapper that foucs on performance,
//maintainability, modularity,	battle testing, extensibility , safety and
//developer frindliness.
//
// To achieve all of the goals, the project is divided into many components. The
// components are desined in a functional style API, whereby objects are
// explicitly passed around as arguments to functions that operate on them.
//
// This tries to avoid defining methods on structs. This comes at a cost of
// limiting chaining, this cost is intential. I intend to work really hard on
// improving perfomance and thus avoiding spaghetti is not an option.
//
// The package is divided into two phases, Query building and Query execution
// phase.
//
// Query Building
//
// The subpackage engine exposes a structure named Engine. This structure has
// everything necessary to build a query. Most of the functions defined in this
// package subpackages operate on this struct by accepting it as the first
// argument.
//
// Having this as a separate layer helps fine tuning the generated querries and
// also it make easy to test and very that the ORM is doing the right thing. So,
// the generated query can be easily optimised without adding a lot of overhead.
//
// Query execution
//
// This is where the generated sql qery is executed. This phase is as generic as
// possible in a way that you can easily implement adoptes for non SQL database
// and still reap all the benefits of this package.
package ngorm

// DB contains information for current db connection
